# Dice Game

A simple interactive browser game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each time you click the roll button, the dice updates to a random value between 1 and 6.

## Features
- Random dice roll on button click
- Dice image updates based on the result
- Clean and simple UI
- No external libraries required

## How It Works
The game uses JavaScript’s `Math.random()` to generate a number from 1 to 6. The script then switches the image source to show the correct dice face.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the project
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
